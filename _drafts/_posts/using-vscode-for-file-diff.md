Until now I've been usind [meld](http://meldmerge.org/) for comparing files, but now in VSCode 1.19 there is a similar functionality. It is called __Compare Active File with Clipboard__ and it's self explanatory. Default key combination is `Ctrl+K C` but as everything, it can be canged in settings: `workbench.files.action.compareWithClipboard`.
